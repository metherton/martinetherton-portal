                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>This family can be traced back to London and the beginning of the 19th Century.&nbsp;Modern day descendents can now be found in (amongst other places) Canada (Ontario), U.S.A (Maryland & New York State), The Netherlands, England (Essex, Kent & Sheffield).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h1>Origins</h1>
                <p>The root ancestor of this branch is Samuel Etherton, who first appears (for definite) in 1836, where his marriage to Mary Rogers is registered at St.Matthews Church, Bethnal Green, London.</p>
                <p>The birth of Samuel is not 100% verifiable but a birth for a Samuel Etherton is registered in 1812 at St.Giles Church, London. Only the mothers name appears on the registration, Charlotte Etherton, for whatever reason, no father appears. Could this be our Samuel Etherton ? It's possible, the year of birth ties in with census records for Samuel which appear in 1841 & 1851. Also Samuel named his second daughter Charlotte. Is this just coincidence or was he naming her after his mother ? Its going to be difficult to ever know the answer to this question. If the father of Samuel was not actually an Etherton then its going to be almost impossible to link this Etherton branch to others using DNA testing, which relies heavily on Y-chromosome matching to establish those links.</p>
                <p>There are other pointers too. Army records for a Daniel Etherton, born 1792 in St.Giles, are found at the London Archives. Samuel named his 4th son Daniel, which again could be just coincidence or perhaps he was naming him after an uncle or cousin.</p>
